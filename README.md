1- Download Python:
   Get the latest Python release here:
   https://www.python.org/downloads/
   WHEN SETTING UP MAKE SURE TO ENABLE "Add to PATH"!!! IMPORTANT!

2- Desktop Folder Requirement:
   You need to have the "deepd" folder on your desktop otherwise DeepDown Terminal won't work correctly. Also make suer your Desktop is in your user and not somewhere else. Should be something like C:/Users/YourUser/Desktop/deepd

3- PCAP Requirement:
   Some tools in DeepD require a pcap. You can get nmap (comes with a pcap) or get pcap seperately:
   https://www.nmap.org

4- Windows Compatibility:
   DeepD is only supported on Windows 10, and I WON'T be making a version for Windows 11 anytime soon.
   
5- Install needed packages:
   Run the "Packages_install" batch file to download needed libraries. When installing python you need to check "add to PATH" otherwise pip wont be recognized as a command.

6- Final Setup:
   Once all of this is done, DeepD should work. If it doesn't, contact me on Discord for help (downiemsf).

7- Discord Connection:
   BEWARE! DeepD is connected through Discord and will be displayed as an activity on Discord!!

I will be making more version, improving expanding and bug fixing DeepDown Terminal. If you find a bug contact me through discord (downiemsf). I plan on making the setup easier too. Ill keep you updated.
